## üì¶ Installation

journal.nvim can be installed just like you install any other Neovim plugin.

### Lazy.nvim

```lua
{
    "jakobkhansen/journal.nvim",
    config = function()
        require("journal").setup()
    end,
},
```

TODO: Add Packer at least

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can configure journal.nvim by passing a table to the setup function. The following
table are the options and default values:

```lua
{
    filetype = 'md',                    -- Filetype to use for new journal entries
    root = '~/journal',                 -- Root directory for journal entries
    date_format = '%d/%m/%Y',           -- Date format for `:Journal <date-modifier>`
    autocomplete_date_modifier = "end", -- "always"|"never"|"end". Enable date modifier autocompletion

    -- Configuration for journal entries
    journal = {
        -- Default configuration for `:Journal <date-modifier>`
        format = '%Y/%m-%B/daily/%d-%A',
        template = '# %A %B %d %Y\n',
        frequency = { day = 1 },

        -- Nested configurations for `:Journal <type> <type> ... <date-modifier>`
        entries = {
            day = {
                format = '%Y/%m-%B/daily/%d-%A', -- Format of the journal entry in the filesystem.
                template = '# %A %B %d %Y\n',    -- Optional. Template used when creating a new journal entry
                frequency = { day = 1 },         -- Optional. The frequency of the journal entry. Used for `:Journal next`, `:Journal -2` etc
            },
            week = {
                format = '%Y/%m-%B/weekly/week-%W',
                template = "# Week %W %B %Y\n",
                frequency = { day = 7 },
                date_modifier = "monday" -- Optional. Date modifier applied before other modifier given to `:Journal`
            },
            month = {
                format = '%Y/%m-%B/%B',
                template = "# %B %Y\n",
                frequency = { month = 1 }
            },
            year = {
                format = '%Y/%Y',
                template = "# %Y\n",
                frequency = { year = 1 }
            },
        },
    }
}
```

All string values can be replaced by functions that return strings. `format` and
`template` options also get a [`Date`](lua/journal/date.lua) argument.

All `format` and `template` options are parsed with `vim.fn.strftime`. To see the available variables, see
`:h strftime` and `man strftime`. Note that `strftime` can have different behavior based on platform.

## üñãÔ∏è The `:Journal` command

`:Journal <type> <type> ... <date-modifier>` can be used to access all your journal
entries. `:Journal` takes the following arguments:

- `<type>`: An entry type (e.g. `day`, `week` etc) to determine which entry-type to open. Can be nested
- `<date-modifier>`. A date-modifier to determine which date the entry is for. If no date
  is provided, defaults to today. If `date_modifier` is specified for the given entry type,
  it is applied before the `<date-modifier>` argument is applied

### Date-modifiers

The `:Journal` command can take a plethora of different date-modifiers to determine which
entry should be opened:

- Weekdays (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`...): The date for the current weeks instance
  of the given weekday
- Date-string (e.g. `10/05/2024`): Parses the date-string to a date according to the `date_format` option
- `+n`/`-n` (e.g. `-1`, `+5`, ...): Relative date. Computes the relative
  date with `n*frequency`, meaning `:Journal week -1` will go one week back, while `:Journal day +1`
  will one day forward
- `last`/`next`: Same as `-1`/`+1`
- `n` (e.g. `1`, `18`, ...): Gets the date for the nth day of the month

## üìö Entries

Each entry type in the `entries` table correspond to a `:Journal <type>` command. Running
`:Journal <type>` will create a journal entry file with a path given by the `format`
option and fills the file with the `template` option. For example `:Journal week` could
create an entry with the path `2024/05-May/weekly/week-19`, pre-filled with the template
`# Week 19 May 2024`.

### Custom entry types

You can also define custom entry types in your journal by simply adding more entry types to the
`entries` table. A `quarter` entry type could be configured like so:

```lua
{
    journal = {
        entries = {
            -- Entry type for each quarter of the year
            quarter = {
                -- strftime doesn't supply a quarter variable, so we compute it manually
                format = function(date)
                    local quarter = math.ceil(tonumber(os.date("%m", os.time(date.date))) / 3)
                    return "%Y/quarter/" .. quarter
                end,
                template = function(date)
                    local quarter = math.ceil(os.date("%m", os.time(date.date)) / 3)
                    return "# %Y Quarter " .. quarter .. "\n"
                end,
                frequency = { month = 3 },
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This entry type will generate entry-paths such as `2024/quarter/2.md`.

### Nested entry types

You can also define nested entry types in your journal in order to group different entry
types by adding an `entries` table to any of your entry types. This allows you to run
commands such as `:Journal groupA week` and `:Journal groupB week`. Journal entries can be
arbitrarily nested to support as much grouping as you want. The following table shows how
you can create two groups with individual `day` and `week` entry types in separate folders.

```lua
{
    journal = {
        entries = {
            groupA = {
                -- `:Journal groupA`
                format = 'groupA/%Y/%m-%B/daily/%d-%A',
                template = "# Group A %A %B %d %Y\n",
                frequency = { day = 1 },

                entries = {
                    -- `:Journal groupA day`
                    day = {
                        format = 'groupA/%Y/%m-%B/daily/%d-%A',
                        template = "# Group A %A %B %d %Y\n",
                        frequency = { day = 1 },
                    },
                    -- `:Journal groupA week`
                    week = {
                        format = 'groupA/%Y/%m-%B/weekly/week-%W',
                        template = "# Group A Week %W %B %Y\n",
                        frequency = { day = 7 },
                        date_modifier = "monday"
                    },
                }
            },
            groupB = {
                -- `:Journal groupB`
                format = 'groupB/%Y/%m-%B/daily/%d-%A',
                template = "# Group B %A %B %d %Y\n",
                frequency = { day = 1 },

                entries = {
                    -- `:Journal groupB day`
                    day = {
                        format = 'groupB/%Y/%m-%B/daily/%d-%A',
                        template = "# Group B %A %B %d %Y\n",
                        frequency = { day = 1 },
                    },
                    -- `:Journal groupB week`
                    week = {
                        format = 'groupB/%Y/%m-%B/weekly/week-%W',
                        template = "# Group B Week %W %B %Y\n",
                        frequency = { day = 7 },
                        date_modifier = "monday"
                    },
                }
            },
        }
    }
}
```

### Multiple journals

While grouping probably covers most users need for grouping different entries, it is also
possible to have completely separate journal directories. One could achieve this by
setting the `root` option to a common folder such as `~` and then specify the folders in
the `format` of each entry type.

Another option is to set the `root` field to a function which returns the root directory
of the journal. This function could return different directories based on cwd (`uv.cwd()`)
or user input. The following function could be used to show a list of directories and let
the user pick one:

```lua
{
    root = function()
        local journal_dir = nil
        vim.ui.select(
            { "~/journal1", "~/journal2" },
            { prompt = "Select journal directory" },
            function(selection) journal_dir = selection end
        )
        return journal_dir
    end,
}
```

## ü™ü Windows support

journal.nvim will work great for most users on Windows. However, due to the missing
implementation of `vim.fn.strptime`, accessing a journal entry via the date-string
date-modifier will not always work great. journal.nvim tries to translate the
`date_format` option into a format which `Get-Date` in Windows can understand (but this is
not a 1:1 mapping). This allows most sane date-formats to be used as datestrings, but
expect to see issues if you use a complex `date_format` option on Windows.
